<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project is created to demonstrate my programming skills and knowledge in different technologies, especially in React.

For package management, I used npm.

The test consisted of three differentiated tasks. The first one was to layout the provided template as best as possible, along with the following functionalities:
  - The list should be put to download in a csv.
  - It will have two viewing modes, in list or in cards.
  - Option of items per page, to be able to choose how many items are displayed per page
  - The search engine will have to search by patient's name and/or surname.
  - The "Actions" dropdown, should show the following options, in card view the options are shown as buttons:
    - Edit
    - Finish
    - Delete
  - Change some columns:

  This has been the most time consuming, approximately the whole afternoon of the first day of testing and the morning of the next day. Mainly due to the fact that I had to layout almost the whole page and apply all the functionalities.

  The second task took me a couple of hours, it consisted in making a form for the client to enter information.

  And finally the third one took me the rest of the time, mainly because I couldn't get the image I downloaded in the pdf to position properly.
